    "\n",
    "1) If you are doing your homework in a Jupyter/iPython notebook you may need to 'Restart & Clear Output' after making a change and re-running a cell.  TensorFlow will not allow you to create multiple variables with the same name, which is what you are doing when you run a cell that creates a variable twice.<br/><br/>\n",
    "2) Be careful with your calls to global_variables_initializer(). If you call it after training one network it will re-initialize your variables erasing your training.  In general, double check the outputs of your model after all training and before turning your model in. Ending a session will discard all your variable values.\n",
